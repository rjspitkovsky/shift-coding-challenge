# SHIFT MARKETS TIMER CHALLENGE

The challenge was to build a timer that starts by clicked a button. When the button is clicked again, the split time is added to a ```<ul>``` on the page. Clicking a split time will reset the timer to the split, highlight the split, and delete all splits longer than the clicked split.

The project is run on a local server via npm. Please contact me at rjspitkovsky@gmail.com with any questions.
